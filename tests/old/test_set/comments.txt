[Generated new Issue]
why don't we allow list of functions to be list of independent variables?
e.g. f1, f2, f3, ..., fn are defined using functional expressions
and then say plot all these functions as functions of x
e.g.
f1 <-x
f2 <-x
....
fn <-x
Instead we could say
f <- [f1, f2, ..., fn]
f <- x
(this saves space I guess)
(checkout test_set/[6]functional_expression.fu)

******************
Are we allowing composed functions?
t <- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x <- t^2
y <- sin(x)
z <- log(y)
Is this allowed?
